A Heads-up Poker Equity Calculator with or without a Board written in Python

This will be a display of all the possible poker cards in a deck with two slots for two hands.
There will also be 5 slots for the cards in the board and have an option to calculate the equity, which is the chance a hand wins or ties at different stages.
These stages, include having two hands at preflop (an empty board), flop (3 cards on the board), turn (4 cards on the board), and the river (5 cards on the board).
